Cabe destacar la tranquilidad del barrio, cerca de los mejores bares y restaurantes de mendoza y a su vez, no tanto del bullicio de las calles principales. Ideal para descansar y ni pensar donde dejar el auto, ya que en la misma calle se podía hacer sin tener miedo que pasara algo. Geraldine estuvo en todo momento en contacto con nosotros y si teniamos alguna consulta o inquietud, siempre estaba ahi!. Tuvimos un imprevisto a la hora de irnos hacia Chile, ya que, por una interminable tormenta de nieve, el cruce permaneció cerrado 6 días, y en un momento de mucha preocupación para nosotros, tuvimos una respuesta muy agradable y reparadora por parte de ella al generarnos una nueva reserva. Lamentablemente no pudimos conocernos personalmente, (no creo falte oportunidad) ya que ella estaba del otro lado de la cordillera \"sufriendo\" lo mismo que nosotros a la hora de intentar cruzar. Algunos puntos a destacar del loft serian, que es bien amplio y equipado, muy buena señal de wi-fi, excelente ubicación para descansar y muy moderno. Muchas gracias por todo y seguro volveremos!

I had a such a great time in Mendoza that I opted to stay an extra day; when I asked Geraldine if that was ok she immediately said yes and took care of everything required with AirBnB, leaving me with no extra work at all. She even followed up with me every day of my stay to see how I was doing and if I needed anything and offered to call me a car to the airport the day I left.
