The loft is a bit walking distance (15-20mins) from the town, but there is a big supermarket nearby where we bought cheap food to cook. When we first come in, their neighbors made us cakes and their kids gave us lavender :) If you like cats, they have two cats and one of them is really playful.

Nevertheless Jenny patiently waited and welcomed us at her beautiful loft. It did not stop there as the rental agency canceled our reservation due to late arrival and there were no cars available in the entire city that day. But Jenny tremendously helped us get a car from the rental company with negotiations in Spanish. She also helped us to get a fantastic tour to walk on ice at Perito Moreno. The loft itself is cozy and comfortable with everything taken care of from kitchen to shower to bed, and it also has a nice view to the lake. And their little kids are so cute to be around.

Most organisation took place with Jenny who was happy to message or (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) or take calls about logistics and questions.\r\nThe townhouse is located at the front of their property. It has a couch and small dining table downstairs, a fridge/freezer and adequate cooking utensils (gas stove and oven, kettle, but no microwave). The bathroom is clean and hot water is stable. Upstairs (may not be suitable for small children) is a loft with some views of the lake and a comfortable bed with a TV (didn't use it) and a sitting desk. The whole house is heated by a gas heater downstairs and kept the house warm even during the cold nights (down to 0C). It also means clothing will dry quickly when hung up. Wifi single is good throughout and connection is stable. Overall it is extremely comfortable.\r\nLocation is a bit further out from town. It takes 20-25min walk to town or ARS70-80 taxi. It is a very straight and pleasant walk if the weather is ok. There is a small bakery and general store (no fruit or vegetables) and a butcher around the corner. Otherwise you need to go toward town about 15min walk to a larger supermarket.\r\nBefore arrival, Jenny arranged the Big Ice tour with Hielo y Aventura for the same retail price but it meant they would pick us up from a nearby hotel, whereas the company refused to do that for me directly. She washed our clothes (for small price) which was welcome after many days hiking. Jenny also was available to answer any questions about the town, the hike, and booked an airport transfer too, allowing a late checkout for free on that day.\r\nMany thanks Jenny and Juan!","created_at":"2016-11-07T11:35:04Z","id":112750376,"language":"en","localized_date":"Noviembre de 2016","response":"Your welcome¡¡Have nice trip¡¡¡","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Juan & Jenny","host_name":"Juan & Jenny","id":15027576,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/15027576/profile_pic/1399402658/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/15027576"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Wei-Yun","host_name":"Wei-Yun","id":766601,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/766601/profile_pic/1344911327/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/766601"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"This is a great house to stay in El Calafate - clean, perfect location, and well equipped to make it feel like home.

It was ideal for self catering which we were desperate to do having eaten out everyday for a week or so. Upstairs there is also a big space with a very big comfortable bed and a really good view outside of Lago Argentina and the mountains beyond. The whole place is very clean and we had a fabulous week there. It is in a good neighbourhood with an excellent Panaderia nearby, also a really good barber and supermarket 5 min walk. Downtown is 15min walk. Jenny and Juan are very busy people, Jenny is a free lance tour guide and Juan a mountain guide, they also have a young child but despite their work and family commitments they were really helpful to us giving advice, picking up and dropping off at the bus station and Jenny saved us a great deal of money and time in negotiating an expensive tour on our behalf. They live next door and they spoke with us each day to see how we were or needed anything,this was not intrusive, however.\r\nThey are a really nice family and have no hesitation in recommending a stay here.","created_at":"2016-01-30T11:11:26Z","id":60948183,"language":"en","localized_date":"Enero de 2016","response":"Thank you to visit Patagonia and our home!!!!","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Juan & Jenny","host_name":"Juan & Jenny","id":15027576,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/15027576/profile_pic/1399402658/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/15027576"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Anthony","host_name":"Anthony","id":46271804,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/46271804/profile_pic/1444582789/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/46271804"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Jenny and Juan were wonderful.
