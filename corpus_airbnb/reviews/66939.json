Twenty floors up and you can see the city 180 degrees. \nWe were greeted by Marcelo on arrival. He was amazing with explaining everything about the apartment and surrounding services.

Amazing. \nThe apartment is exactly the way you see it in the photos on Airbnb. Very well presented and a big bowl of fresh fruit and water available on arrival. \nThe apartment was located centrally to the wonderful Palermo area, filled with wonderful coffee shops, restaurants and craft beer houses. \nOne coffee shop in particular called 'Lattente' located near corner of Paraguay and Thames (approx 10 min walk from apartment) roast their own coffee beans and really care about their craft. They have basic breakfast items and Pastry treats. We went every morning :) \nWe had 5 nights at the apartment and Ralf was helpful in replacing our towels after 3 days My wife enjoyed the gym upstairs and I loved relaxing on the wonderful balcony with the magic view and cool breeze. Wifi in the apartment was exceptional also.

We also could have missed some stuff since we weren't there very long. \nThe apartment was GORGEOUS!! Other than choosing his place for the area, I definitely chose it for how beautifully it was decorated and organized. Not one detail was left behind. Everything was very thought out and very user friendly. We felt very much at home at Ralf's. \nRalf was also amazing. Our bus was late and he was very accommodating to letting us in two hours after we originally told him. He greeted us when we arrived and went over every single detail to make sure we were comfortable. He explained the heat, after, tv controls, coffee, balcony doors, shower, water temp etc. He also left us fresh fruit, coffee and water which was very thoughtful!

It's only two blocks from a main thoroughfare, with access to the metro, tons of shops and restaurants, and wonderful (and spotless) parks and open spaces. The apartment came equipped with everything we needed, including a subway card. We opted for the optional car service to and from the airport, which was well worth the extra cost. The airport is about 45 minutes away, and both of our flights were in the evening, so trying to arrange transportation on our own would have been daunting. Aside from some momentary confusion at check in, the only slight (and rather funny) hiccup occurred on our last day. We checked out at the regular time, but because our flight wasn't until that evening, the host stored our bags in his space until the car was ready to take us to the airport. Just before we were ready to collect our bags, the host accidentally locked the key to the apartment housing our bags, inside. We had to wait for one of his assistants to arrive with a spare key, which put us about 15 minutes behind. The driver must have known we were running late, because he drove very aggressively, like super aggressively, to the airport. Somehow we arrived in one piece, so no foul. Just a funny story to cap our wonderful stay in this beautiful apartment.
