The location was terrific if you want to move around BA - a couple blocks from the subway stop, and close to parks, great restaurants, some excellent museums. It's not quite in the heart of Palermo Soho - about 10-15 minute walk away - but location worked very well for us. The rooftop indoor gym was fantastic - a big benefit. The outdoor pool looked nice but is closed during the Argentine winter. There is laundry in building but we used a very cheap laundromat nearby and also shopped at a close-by supermarket. The apt kitchen is solid and the apt has all the adapters you need. Ralf/Marcelo did an excellent job getting us situated and even provided a subway fare card and answered all our questions. The experience was even better than our already high expectations.

The neighborhood is lively enough to be fun, but residential enough to be safe and peaceful. There's hardly any noise up on the 25th floor! It's a city, so groceries are divided among produce stores, liquor stores, and dry goods, but all of these are within a block or two. \r\n\r\nSecond, amenities: The apartment is exactly the way it looks in the pictures, with a jaw-dropping view. You have cable television, laundry in the building, a security gate, a gym, and even a 31st floor hot tub. The bed is very comfortable, and the shower always has hot water (neither of these are givens in South America!). \r\n\r\nFinally, service: Everyone at the rental company is friendly and easy to deal with. Marcelo gave us an extensive tour when we arrived, and the people in the office were great over the phone when we had questions.

My travel partner and I arrived after a overnight flight from Dallas, Texas.  Although standard check-in time is in the afternoon -- I believe 3PM -- the host company, BA4U, allowed us to check in early.  This was much appreciated, as the 10-1/2 hour flight was rather exhausting.  We were greeted at the Loft by Marcelo, a team member of BA4U.  Marcelo was very gracious and helpful.  Not only did he explain in detail how the lights, appliances, and other devices inside the Loft operate, he gave us a \"crash course\" in the \"do's and dont's\" of visiting Buenos Aires (BA).  This was very helpful, as it was our first time visiting BA.  Marcelo's main objective was making sure we remained safe in the city.  It was a unexpected bonus from our welcoming host.  \r\n\r\nThe 32-floor building was fantastic.  It looks like a creation by the world-famous design company Arquitectonica.  Perhaps it is.  There is a gym on the 31st floor with a all-glass panoramic view of the city.  Two hot tubs -- one on either side of the building -- and a sauna are on the 32nd floor.  The hot tubs also look out to the city.  There is a balcony outside our loft with a small table and 2 chairs, which overlooks the vast and dense city below.  Each morning we would enjoy a peaceful breakfast on the balcony, complete with a glass of native Malbec wine.\r\n\r\nThe customer service from the BA4U team was exemplary.  There was a short, temporary outage of the internet service, and another team member of BA4U, Ralf, showed up at our door to apologize for the inconvenience, and said the issue was already being addressed.  Within 15 minutes the service was back up and running.  Ralf stopped by the condo once again to make sure everything was okay, and told us not to hesitate to contact him or any of the other team members of BA4U should any other needs arise.  \r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the stay in \"my home away from home\", and when I visit BA again, I will for certain look to see if this same loft is available.\r\n","created_at":"2016-04-18T03:53:18Z","id":70461464,"language":"en","localized_date":"Abril de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Ralf","host_name":"Ralf","id":319901,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2990f046-56a1-4fb8-b8b2-175e83916709.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/319901"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Chris","host_name":"Chris","id":40705800,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/40705800/profile_pic/1438882446/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/40705800"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Wir hatten das Apartment für fast vier Wochen gemietet und es hat sich wirklich gelohnt.

Also the balcony has the AC back units and hence is always hot and you can't sit and enjoy the balcony with the hot air blowing on you.

The apartment is well-equipped and comfortably furnished, clean, and secure. The 25th floor location provided astounding views of Palermo as well as surprising serenity high above the noise of the city. Our stay here has influenced us to schedule our return to Buenos Aires around this apartment's availability alone.","created_at":"2015-08-08T16:44:31Z","id":41672682,"language":"en","localized_date":"Agosto de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Ralf","host_name":"Ralf","id":319901,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2990f046-56a1-4fb8-b8b2-175e83916709.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/319901"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Erik","host_name":"Erik","id":553555,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/553555/profile_pic/1398978249/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/553555"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Very nice apartment in the heart of Buenos Aires.  The apartment was as advertised, and overall was a very comfortable place to stay.  Ralf and his team were very professional and responsive.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a great experience.  Highlights are the central location in Palermo, and the great views of the city, especially from the rooftop gym.\r\n\r\nI'll definitely stay there again when I'm back in town.  \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nDavid C\r\nSeattle, WA","created_at":"2015-08-03T15:56:44Z","id":40971817,"language":"en","localized_date":"Agosto de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Ralf","host_name":"Ralf","id":319901,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2990f046-56a1-4fb8-b8b2-175e83916709.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/319901"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"David","host_name":"David","id":12032904,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/12032904/profile_pic/1391895187/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/12032904"}}],"metadata":{"reviews_count":144,"should_show_review_translations":true}}
