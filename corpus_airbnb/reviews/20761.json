The full bathroom is well equipped and it was nice having a half bath downstairs. My husband, two adult children (son 25 yr and daughter 20 yr) stayed two nights in BA. The kids shared a bedroom with 2 twins and my husband I had had the master bedroom. Both were upstairs. \n\nWe Ubered everywhere (except the Italian restaurant). One morning we grabbed a quick breakfast in the bakery just down stairs. \n\nThe balconies were a lovely addition. The decor was modern.

Guido left a guide for the area with several restaurants listed, we tried 3 of them and loved them all. The grocery store was within walking distance along a smaller market.  There is a cute little bar downstairs if you wanted to grab a quick drink and feel like you were a part of the neighborhood. We enjoyed all the balconies, which were great for breakfast or a glass of wine at the end of the day. The apartment was a great size for 3 friends, and the 1/2 bath downstairs made getting ready in the morning easy for everyone.
