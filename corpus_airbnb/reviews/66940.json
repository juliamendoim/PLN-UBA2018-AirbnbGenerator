Our wonderful experience in the Pool Party studio began when we met Ralf. We were fresh off a 20 hour bus ride and, as the apartment was vacant the night before, Ralf kindly allowed us to check in early. He met us at the apartment and gave us a detailed overview of the apartment and the neighborhood. He was very friendly and welcoming; he even left us with a beautiful bowl of fruit and cookies. It was a pleasure to meet him and read his entertaining and descriptive reviews of the local restaurants, which he kindly provides in an informative binder. He gave us great tips for a nearby brunch spot which was just what we needed after the bus ride. As for the apartment, it is absolutely gorgeous. It looks exactly like the photos: modern, spotless, and comfortable. It was awesome to have a fully equipped kitchen, comfortable bed, lovely bathroom, fast internet, and a cute porch. We also really appreciated the gym facilities on the 31st floor. What an amazing view! We peeked in on the jacuzzi and sauna (both looked really nice) but didn't have a chance to try them. It was too cold for us to enjoy the pool- next time! The apartment is located in a fabulous part of town; close to all of the cute shops and innovative restaurants for which Palermo is famous. We loved walking around the safe and friendly neighborhood. In summary, this apartment is an incredible bargain. We look forward to staying with Ralf on future visits to Buenos Aires!

The apartment is in an awesome location, close to many great shopping and dining locations in Palermo. We were greeted with a thorough explanation of the apartment amenities and things to do in the neighborhood by Tomas in excellent English. There was also a guide to recommended restaurants written by Ralf in the apartment, as well as many other great guides to eating and tourism around Buenos Aires. The apartment was clean and included great amenities, such as TV (with channels in both English and Spanish), speakers, plug adapters, and coffee maker. The balcony was also greatly enjoyed during our stay.  The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking meals if you'd like, although not eating out in Buenos Aires seems like a sin. Overall, the apartment setup was phenomenal and the location was ideal for our stay in Buenos Aires. My boyfriend and I will definitely be returning!
