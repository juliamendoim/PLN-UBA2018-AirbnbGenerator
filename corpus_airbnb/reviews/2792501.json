Die Wohnung befindet in perfekter Lage für ein Stadturlaub, weil sich alles ganz in der Nähe befindet – sie könnte nicht besser gelegen sein. Sie befindet sich im 16 Stockwerk und bietet einen atemberaubenden Blick über Palermo bis zum Fluss. Vom Balkon aus kann man erst ermessen wie unglaublich groß das Häusermeer von Buenos Aires ist. Das Beste: Auf dem Dach befindet sich ein schöner Pool sowie Sonnenliegen, Sitzgelegenheiten, ein kleines Gym und ein Grillplatz. Die Sonnenuntergänge, die vom Dach aus beobachtet werden können (das haben wir fast jeden Abend getan) sind unbezahlbar. Die Wohnung selbst hat viele Vorzüge: sie ist wirklich sauber und sicher, unten gibt es einen Portier, das Internet läuft flüssig etc. Die Gastgeberin Maria Ines ist unglaublich freundlich, hilfsbereit und rund um die Uhr telefonisch oder per (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) erreichbar. Sie hat uns viele schöne Tips gegeben bezüglich Restaurants, Museen, Verkehr, Sehenswürdigkeiten etc. Die Wohnung ist super ausgerüstet und hat wirklich alles, was man zum Kochen braucht. Es gibt ein riesiges Bockspringbett (was mir sehr wichtig war), in dem ich herrlich geschlafen habe. Zudem gibt es eine leicht zu bedienende Klimaanlage. Was noch erwähnt werden soll, Maria Ines hat auch unseren Flughafentransport organisiert. Ich kann die Wohnung wirklich empfehlen!

She provided me information in a timely manner and additionally secured a pick up from the airport. All of these efforts satisfied my husband and myself as Buenos Aires is a big city with hurdles to deal with when traveling. \n\nMaria also had Luis meet us at the apartment which was comforting. Maria also had guide books and maps handy with suggestions. \n\nThe apartment is true to its advertisement it is in \"the center of the action\". An easy walk to many cultural sites, the subway and supermarkets. This made my husband and my time well spent as we were able to soak up the expansive and diverse culture of Buenos Aires. The apartment is very spacious with high ceilings, comfortable living room furniture; also clean from top to bottom. \n\nThe kitchen is filled with pots, pans, utensils and other amenities such as basic spices to assist you. My husband and I never really acclimated to eating on Buenos Aires time of after 10 pm; therefore the kitchen became the focal point of our stay after 7 pm. It was simply easier to pick up what we wanted from the supermarket or bakery (there are so many nearby) and relax at home with a prepared meal, \n\nThe bathroom (I loved the additional half bathroom) is accommodating and provided us with ample room to get situated each day without really bumping into one another. \n\nThe bedroom has a king size bed that is comfortable and coupled with the black out blinds we were able to sleep very soundly. There is ample closet space with plenty of drawers to put clothes in. Also I really liked having a safe in the bedroom (please note there were no security issues with building at all) as it allowed us to store more personal items away.\n\nThe wifi and the cable television were an extra benefit as it allowed us to be in touch with friends and family as needed in addition to decompress and talk with each other after a long day of seeing the sites. \n\nEven thou this apartment is comfy and packed with amenities you may find yourself reluctant to leave however it is vitally important to see the vast number of neighborhoods (Palermo, La Boca, San Telmo just to name a few) in Buenos Aires. I highly recommend that you contact Maria to secure this apartment. \n","created_at":"2015-07-15T11:44:09Z","id":38375703,"language":"en","localized_date":"Julio de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Maria","host_name":"Maria","id":2016724,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2016724/profile_pic/1375233009/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/2016724"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Charles And Heiko","host_name":"Charles And Heiko","id":29877595,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/29877595/profile_pic/1436565422/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/29877595"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"A estadia foi perfeita, a localização do apartamento é ótima e a Maria Inês e o Luiz são muito atenciosos.","created_at":"2015-07-03T11:44:36Z","id":36949971,"language":"pt","localized_date":"Julio de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Maria","host_name":"Maria","id":2016724,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2016724/profile_pic/1375233009/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/2016724"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Cristiane","host_name":"Cristiane","id":31099320,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b4b82ed1-4664-4512-aa32-dda57b1b1bee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/31099320"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Maria is great and her apt is clean and comfortable.

Fomos muitos bem recebidos com cervejas, vinho e toda simpatia do Luiz (administrador do apartamento), alem de todas as orientações, dicas sobre locais, transporte, moedas. Durante toda a viagem Luiz e Maria Ines mantiveram contato esclarecendo duvidas, enviando mapas e dicas preciosas de Buenos Aires, com muitas opções de locais para visitar, comer, etc. Os funcionários do condomínio também muito educados e prestativos. Bairro tranquilo, seguro, bem frequentado, com ótimas opções de restaurante. Ótimo para um caminhada, principalmente nos fins de semana.
