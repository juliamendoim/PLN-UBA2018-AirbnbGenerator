The view from the rooftop deck was amazing and allowed us to enjoy some lovely sunrises and sunsets. We also really appreciated the coffee pods and the bottle of wine Soledad left us. \n\nI do want to mention something about the jacuzzi. We primarily booked this apartment because of the rooftop jacuzzi, and maybe this is a lost in translation sort of thing, but the jacuzzi was not exactly what we were expecting. The jacuzzi itself does not have any sort of water heating functionality. You fill it with hot water from two additional hot water heaters, but the water quickly gets cold. The tub does have jets and such, so I guess it is technically a jacuzzi, but you can't stay in it for more than half an hour before the water is cold. It also takes probably half an hour of preparation (filling it up, adjusting the temperature) before you can actually use it.

The space is so cozy and perfect in size for 2 people with a cute little kitchen and a very nice bathroom with a bidet!  We loved it so much that we're planning on putting a bidet in our home.  The upstairs terrace is SO beautiful.  We didn't get a chance to see it our first part of our stay because of the rain, but when we came back, it was the first thing we did - go upstairs to look.  The winter weather didn't allow for us to really spend time up there, but we are looking forward to coming back next year for a stay again and hopefully we'll have more opportunity to enjoy the terrace.  We have found our go to spot in Palermo!","created_at":"2016-09-19T14:51:45Z","id":102901931,"language":"en","localized_date":"Septiembre de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Soledad","host_name":"Soledad","id":1098816,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1098816/profile_pic/1314922914/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/1098816"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Shane","host_name":"Shane","id":2688261,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2688261/profile_pic/1340168064/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/2688261"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"We absolutely loved this place.

We spent our honeymoon week here, and it was a fantastic visit.  The apartment is lovely, and the rooftop deck is a true refuge.  We met in Palermo SoHo 5 years ago, and this apartment was the perfect way to return to the neighborhood.  Soledad has thought of everything, right down to artisanal soap, toothbrushes, luxuriously large towels, and a capsule coffee machine to get the day rolling before you venture out for a stronger coffee and medialunas -- or empanadas -- in the neighborhood.  We walked and walked and walked, and then walked some more to explore not only Palermo, but many other parts of town, as well.  Returning each afternoon for a nap behind the very effective blackout shades and a jacuzzi before dinner was really a luxury.  The key turnover was super easy and convenient both at the beginning and end of our stay.  Soledad was an easy text message away on the couple occasions when we needed a bit of extra help.  She very kindly arranged our transportation back to the airport when my sub-par Spanish failed me.  Soledad and her family were very friendly, the place is gorgeous, and the value can't be beat.
