Es para amantes de la naturaleza y el campo ya que está en un monte de olivos, en las afueras de Luján del Cuyo. La casa es hermosa, con un diseño y decorado entre moderno y rústico. Alex nos recibió con mucha amabilidad y su hermana Laura nos ayudó desde irnos a buscar a la terminal de ómnibus, hasta hacernos las reservas a bodegas. También sugerencias donde abastecernos y sitios para conocer. Muy amables y simpáticos los dos. La gatita Azuca es divina y no molesta para nada. Solo hay que darle de comer y entrarla en las noches. Para los que se preocupan por la seguridad, la casa está en un lugar aislado pero en un barrio privado con entrada con garita. Las vistas de los Andes son espectaculares.

But I would like to comment in a few things. We love to receive people and run this Airbnb mostly to give travellers the experience of being in our house that we built with effort and love.I am deeply sorry that you didn't call me during your stay to tell me about the loose light switch in the stairs and that the tap went loose in the kitchen, I would had go with our maintenance person to fix it in a moment, as well as glue the 4 tiles in the shower. That is why we have this person available for us all day any time. Maybe you felt like you didn't want to bother me but as I told you and always remark our guests is that it is very important for us to be available 24/7. It was a shame. The house is almost brand new and it is exactly as you can see it in the add photos. Being a house, there will always be things to fix and maintain due to the constant use but I went shocked and really sad when I read that in your opinion the house shows significant signs of decay. You are absolutely right about the things you mention that we should fix, thank you for that, I already fixed them, were things really fast to fix. The rusty metals that you mention as a sign of decay are part of the architectural design of the house witch is made by rusty looking metal, stones, glass and wood trying to blend it with the original landscape. Thank you for consider us friendly and helpful hosts, again it was a shame you did not call me to fix those things. I will remark even more in the future that I am here to help and fix anything that may not work in the house and for anything in general. Thank you one more time for the observations that help us to have the house in the the best condition as possible all the time.\n\nSincerely ,\n\nLaura and Alex","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Alex","host_name":"Alex","id":37619510,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/37619510/profile_pic/1436822525/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/37619510"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Pepijn","host_name":"Pepijn","id":4544055,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4544055/profile_pic/1437672878/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/4544055"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"We had a lovely time in Mendoza.

The house is so well designed and styled you’ll wish you could live there. You can see views of the mountains and landscape from every room with the floor to ceiling sliding doors that open up completely.  We loved watching the sunrise and sunset from the rooftop that you can walk out on from the bedroom. The kitchen is stocked with all the tools and utensils you’d need for cooking, we actually used it a lot.  The bathrooms and shower are also clean and really, really nice, with warm water and plenty of space to put your toiletries.  Again, the views are amazing and it’s in a quiet neighborhood so the only sounds you hear are the birds outside.  We cannot say enough how amazing this house is.\r\n \r\nOn top of the house being wonderful, the hosts Laura and Alex are extremely accommodating. We did not expect them to help us so much but Laura was in contact with us well before our trip to help plan out our stay. If you’d like, she will plan out your days with reservations and bookings to wineries and activities. If you prefer to do it all yourself, she leaves you with an extended list of recommendations to her favorite wineries and restaurants in the area. (We tried out most of them and they were all really great!) Laura was so responsive and quick to reply whenever we had any questions about the house or area and she made all of the winery reservations for us.  We also rented a car from them, which was really great to get back and forth and explore the area. (You can also choose to have her drive you around if you’d like!)\r\n \r\nWe LOVED the location of the house and the Lujan de Cuyo area. The house is close to many local wineries and the roads were very easy to navigate and find our way around. We HIGHLY recommend staying here for the amazing house, the wonderful location, and amazing hosts that really make your stay smooth and comfortable.

However, it is located about 35 minutes away from Mendoza. We definitely recommend this accommodation if you know how Argentina works. If you are going there for the wine experience make sure to have either a car or a wine tour lined up.

Keep in mind they have siesta and you won't find anything open between 1 pm and 4 pm including restaurants.. So definitely not a place to go for lunch or get a taxi from.\r\n\r\nThere is a winery across the road from the neighborhood main entrance (which is about 700 mts from the house).  the next closest winery is about 3kms away from the main entrance. \r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful place to forget about the world.

It is a map in the profile with the exact location and distances. \r\n\r\nThat is one of the most important wine regions of Mendoza, for that the house is surrounded by the best wineries. \r\n\r\nWe have this village that you well mention called Chacras de Coria where you can find all kind of convenience stores, bakeries, fresh fruits and vegetables stores, farmacies, banks, restaurants, bars, cafes, small wineries, clothing stores, etc. \r\n\r\nAn other good tip you share is about the siesta time. Everything opens from 9am to 1pm and from 4pm to 9pm. Not all of them, you can still find open places, I will inform about them from now on, thanks for that too. \r\n\r\nThe restaurants do not have this brake. We have lots of restaurants in the village and they receive many tourist as well as local people, they have normal schedules and shifts. They are open from 11.30 am and the kitchens close after 12 in the evening.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty options available to have the whole wine experience as well of many other attractions that our province have to offer. I give any guidance to my guests in this regard as well as all options of transportation. \r\n\r\nAnother good observation is about internet acces. What all the guests incluiding me do, is to buy at the airport an argentinian chip, wich is really cheap and with that you will have full internet access in the house that you can share with your computers. \r\n\r\nEvery place in the village provides free wifi.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry about this incident with Azuca, my kitten. As she is very independent and loves to be in the garden, what I do if she gets where she shouldn't while we are eating or cooking, I let her go out play in the garden.

Super bem decorada, em um lugar lindo e bastante seguro! A casa é muito ampla, a cozinha é fantástica e a lareira é perfeita para aproveitar o frio de Mendoza! O quarto e o banheiro também são amplos, bem decorados e iluminados.\r\nO bairro é excelente para quem pretende visitar as vinícolas da região, pois é perto das de Lujan de Cuyo, e metade do caminho para Valle do Uco.\r\nQuem nos atendeu foi Laura, irmã de Alex, um amor de pessoa, fez o que pode para tornar nossa hospedagem a mais agradável possível! Ela nos buscou e levou no aeroporto de Mendoza (que fica a cerca de 40 minutos da casa), e acabamos alugando o carro dela, que foi super cômodo, pois o horário das locadoras de veículo em Mendoza é muito complicado para quem tem voos a noite ou no início da manhã.\r\nRecomendo o local a todos!

She arranged to pick us up from the airport and helped us plan last-minute winery trips and restaurant reservations. Not only did she become our impromptu travel advisor, she offered us a great deal to drive us around town and was the best private driver we could have asked for! All the detours and little moments that we were afforded because of her attention and flexibility created a priceless experience. On top of all this, the house is beautiful with exquisite sunrise views over the mountains, and the house cat Azuca is an added bonus.
