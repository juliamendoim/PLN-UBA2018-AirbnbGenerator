Comunication was great, the apartment is exactly what is in the pictures, which is great! Felt very secured because of the lovely security gentelman 24 hs at the door. Walking everywhere to have the best restaurants and cafes. He even left a few rubber duckies for my daughter to play with in the tub. Definitely gonna come back here on our yearly trip next year.
