An easy walk to Plaza Serrano and the underground tube is 7 minutes walk down the sane street. You can get anywhere in the city so easily! \nSergio is an incredible host. Attentive and organised and everything went absolutely smoothly. Not a glitch with any aspect. The place is great. We used the pool on rooftop and used the balcony bath daily. Loved Buenos Aires. One of the highlights was contacting Delta Unplugged ( check out their (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) page or website or through TripAdvisor) who offer Parana Delta private tours on their boat. We got a private Taxi from the apartment all the way to Tigre and then had an amazing day in the delta. Other highlights was Plaza De Mayo on Thursday when the mothers of The Disappeared meet and march. Get out to San Telmo market too.

The space is exactly as pictured in Sergio's AirBnB listing.  The main floor has the living space, a terrace which overlooks a view of Palermo Hollywood, a half bath, and a small but workable kitchen.  The bedrooms are on the upper floor. The master bedroom shares the same view as the main floor. It opens out onto a terrace with an outdoor shower.  The second bedroom is smaller and doesn't have a view or a terrace.  Since it was just the 2 of us, we used the second bedroom to store our luggage and    cold weather gear for a brief trip to Patagonia.  The space suited us perfectly.  Throughout our month-long stay, we continually talked about how lucky we were to have rented the apartment.  \r\n\r\nWe love the neighborhood. The building's location is in the heart of Palermo Hollywood, and it's a short walk to Palermo Soho.  There is a wonderful bakery/coffee bar downstairs, and no shortage of good restaurants within a few blocks.  \r\n\r\nBe advised that there is also a very lively artisanal beer bar immediately next door to the entrance to building.  The entrance to the apartment is on the 5th floor (4th floor on the elevator button but the ground floor is counted as zero), so the bar's late night revelry was never a problem for us, but we could hear it.  (Bedrooms are on what would be considered the 6th floor.)\r\n\r\nSergio was a great host, and we would rent from him again without hesitation. \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-03-31T23:30:39Z","id":67815503,"language":"en","localized_date":"Marzo de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Sergio","host_name":"Sergio","id":75891,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/75891/profile_pic/1264968642/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/75891"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"R","host_name":"R","id":33934619,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/defaults/user_pic-225x225.png?v=3","profile_path":"/users/show/33934619"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Sergio was welcoming.

The apartment is modern with all of the mod-cons.  Beautifully appointed with a full kitchen and beautiful bath, living area, and balconies (incl hot tub) overlooking the city.\r\nPalermo is full of cool cafes and shops - you'd have to spend weeks or months just to try them all.  Beyond Palermo we tended to walk everywhere, though we did catch Subte some days (beware that Subte stops at 11pm which is weird for a city where people don't eat dinner till 10 or 11 pm).  Sergio was super helpful - emailing beforehand and answering all emails promptly.  Although he wasn't in BA when we stayed, he arranged for a friend (Mariano) to meet us - he too was super helpful.  They helped with exchanging USD both when we arrived as well as later in our stay.  The apartment also has a laundry (if you don't want to use a service in the neighbourhood) - which was also great.. there is a mini-market a block away for necessities.\r\n\r\nWe can't recommend this apartment more highly!","created_at":"2015-10-16T11:01:04Z","id":50913388,"language":"en","localized_date":"Octubre de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Sergio","host_name":"Sergio","id":75891,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/75891/profile_pic/1264968642/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/75891"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Alec","host_name":"Alec","id":334095,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/334095/profile_pic/1294470082/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/334095"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"The best place I could ever pick the location is blocks away from plaza Serrano on your way to it you have a lot of very cute restaurants also clubs are around the corner too and next door is a bakery also a beer pub !!
