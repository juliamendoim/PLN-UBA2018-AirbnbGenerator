The Sky Loft is as amazing as it looks in the photos and its central location was perfect for us (there was a pop up Food Fest two blocks away while we were there that seems to be on a monthly basis so definitely check it out if you're into food trucks and local beers!)\n\nWe took our breakfast on the terrace in the mornings with stunning views over the city and fresh pastries and eggs from the many local shops and bakeries. But when it came to dinner and all that beef, we left it to the pros which is easy to do when two of the best parillas in the city are within a ten minute walk - the legendary Don Julio (we actually went twice) and the Carneceria which you can see from the terrace of the Sky Loft.\n\nRalf had many great suggestions for us and Mooi is fab for brunch (just get there early or you'll be competing with all those exercising in the park for a table). We also made some great discoveries on our own - best bar goes to Victoria Brown (ten minute walk from Sky Loft) where Celia makes an incredible drink!\n\nSome of BsAs other attractions are a bit further away (yes we actually did leave Palermo Soho) but the subway is nearby and super cheap and taxis are in abundance and again very inexpensive (by London standards) so Sky Loft is very well connected.\n\nWe'll definitely stay again when in BsAs!\n\n(Oh and the gym on the 31st floor is great as there was usually just me and one other watching the sun rise over the city from the 180 degree view - makes planks much easier.)","created_at":"2017-06-04T19:57:33Z","id":157801119,"language":"en","localized_date":"Junio de 2017","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Ralf","host_name":"Ralf","id":319901,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2990f046-56a1-4fb8-b8b2-175e83916709.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/319901"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Jeff","host_name":"Jeff","id":4589280,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4589280/profile_pic/1435848718/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/4589280"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Ralph definitely takes the Airbnb experience to the next level.

The location is so wonderful - Palermo is honestly the spot to stay - lots of restaurants and trendy shops just a short stroll from the apartment and only a small cab fare to everything else.  The apartment is modern and very homely - and seriously what a view!! We felt very secure and the building has top notch security which is 24 hours.  There are a few supermarkets very close by for our shopping and banks (ATMs) a short stroll down the road to Santa Fe.  We can't recommend the Skyloft enough - or any of Ralf's apartments for that matter as her has a few in this particular building.  Please don't hesitate to book this as it truly made our stay in Buenos Aires one to remember!
