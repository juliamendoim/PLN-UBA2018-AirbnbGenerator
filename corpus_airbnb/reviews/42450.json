Se mostró muy disponible en todo momento y nos ayudó en lo que necesitamos. Nos acompañó incluso a coger el taxi de vuelta al aeropuerto. El amplio apartamento está muy bien situado en el Centro de San Telmo, un barrio especialmente bullicioso por las noches por lo que no hay que temer al ruido. Está muy bien comunicado con el resto de la ciudad y se encuentra de todo lo necesario a pocos pasos. Hay una abundante oferta de restaurantes, tiendas y ocio, sobre todo los domingos, cuando tiene lugar en la calle el animado mercadillo. El bonito mercado de San Telmo está muy cerca por lo que se puede comprar fruta, verdura y carne fresca. No hay que perderse la exquisita panadería francesa que está en el interior. La casa tiene mucho encanto, sobre todo el salón comedor. Es mejorable la calidad de internet y el equipamiento de cocina y baño, pero eso no ha impedido que pasemos una excelente estancia, hasta el punto de que nos hubiéramos quedado más días. Muchas gracias Grisel por todo. Recomendaremos tanto el barrio como el apartamento a nuestros amigos y nos encantaría volver pronto.

As others have reviewed, it was just as pictured--neat and clean, spacious and charming with a definite French feel.  While the unit is on the 3rd floor, an old-fashioned grilled elevator (which operates fast and efficiently) takes you right to the apartment's front door.  The apartment's 2 bedrooms and 2 baths, the well-equipped kitchen, and the large living room and dining room make this place a great choice for a short or long stay.   Although there were just two of us, it would definitely be plenty roomy for 2 couples.  Grisel was a fine host, very responsive to our advance questions, and provided a wealth of information about the neighborhood, its restaurants, bars, shops, sights, customs and suggestions well before we arrived, giving us lots of time to plan for a great visit to B.A.  Grisel's helper, Andrew, actually greeted us upon arrival and provided an excellent orientation to the apartment as well as further specifics about the San Telmo area and answered any questions we might have had.  The apartment's location on Defensa puts it right in the heart of San Telmo, which is gentrified enough that it's full of great cafes and shops, a place where visitors won't feel unsafe, but still a very authentic section of B.A., with cobblestone streets, old buildings full of character, and regular people who live there.  As active as the area was, the apartment was pleasantly quiet--always nice to return to after a busy day of touring the city.\r\nThank you, Grisel, for making our first trip to B.A. such a happy and memorable one.  We hope it won't be our last and will definitely look forward to staying with you again.","created_at":"2016-10-06T01:52:32Z","id":106382468,"language":"en","localized_date":"Octubre de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Grisel","host_name":"Grisel","id":185437,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/185437/profile_pic/1280471431/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/185437"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Charles","host_name":"Charles","id":14566228,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2b1dd2d1-7a47-4302-9be9-60c661a1637e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/14566228"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Lovely Apartment and we appreciated Giesel arranging transport to and from the Airport.","created_at":"2016-08-31T06:07:33Z","id":98447799,"language":"en","localized_date":"Agosto de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Grisel","host_name":"Grisel","id":185437,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/185437/profile_pic/1280471431/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/185437"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Linda","host_name":"Linda","id":45954256,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c863fc56-0fb7-4f95-a269-e4462071ff04.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/45954256"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Difficile de trouver mieux comme emplacement dans San Telmo avec la rue Defensa qui dévient piétonne le dimanche avec tous les stands d'artisanat.\r\nL'appartement est spacieux, calme, bien équipé et l'arrivée avec l'ascenseur de l'époque ne fait que rendre le lieu encore plus authentique.\r\nL'accueil de Grisel est on ne peut plus sympathique et professionnel.

Despite only two days there, I had a rich and varied taste of life in Buenos Aires.  Grisel gave me good info regarding restaurants (she was on key!!) and a local \"milonga\".  A great thing in this place is that you can walk to main attractions and shopping areas.  I really enjoyed my stay and highly recommend this comfortable place.

Grisel met us on time as arranged and showed us everything we needed to know.  There are guide books for the area and Buenos Aires which helped a lot.  She also took us out to a milonga / tango evening which was great fun. We would stay here again if we come back to Buenos Aires","created_at":"2012-03-04T18:21:53Z","id":968780,"language":"en","localized_date":"Marzo de 2012","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Grisel","host_name":"Grisel","id":185437,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/185437/profile_pic/1280471431/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/185437"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Stuart","host_name":"Stuart","id":1699953,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1699953/profile_pic/1328401830/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/1699953"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Beautiful 2 bedroom apartment, large, spacious, airy, well appointed, comfortable.  \r\n\r\nRight on Defensa which is the street that turns into a huge market on Sundays - 30 minutes from Palermo by cab (in traffic) - close to La Boca.\r\n\r\nVery prompt and helpful service from Grisel the owner - apartment was clean and she was able to meet us when we got in very early in the morning.\r\n\r\nThis was a wonderful place and I would recommend it to anyone.
