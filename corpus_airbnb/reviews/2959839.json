El día que llegamos, nos recibió muy amablemente (hasta nos tenía una botella de agua fría en el refrigerador), nos explicó todo lo relativo al depa y nos dio tips de actividades que podíamos hacer en Buenos Aires. Durante nuestra estadía, mantuvimos una comunicación pronta y fluida y nos ayudó a resolver todo lo que le solicitamos. \n\nEn cuanto al departamento, es precioso y súper cómodo! Tiene todo lo que uno necesita y tiene una excelente ubicación, en el precioso barrio de Recoleta, cerca de bares, restaurantes, un centro comercial paradas de buses. \n\nRecomiendo este apartamento 100% y agradecemos a Juan Carlos por todas sus atenciones :) ","created_at":"2016-04-01T02:54:24Z","id":67844269,"language":"es","localized_date":"Abril de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Juan Carlos","host_name":"Juan Carlos","id":757418,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/757418/profile_pic/1399393611/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/757418"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Daniela","host_name":"Daniela","id":3816371,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/850443cb-3baf-45da-bad5-02c41e826a0e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/3816371"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Muy bonito el departamento, con justo lo necesario, en una excelente zona y Juan Carlos muy atento y servicial , nos sentimos muy agusto.","created_at":"2015-10-09T12:11:20Z","id":50073607,"language":"es","localized_date":"Octubre de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Juan Carlos","host_name":"Juan Carlos","id":757418,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/757418/profile_pic/1399393611/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/757418"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Oscar","host_name":"Oscar","id":40295367,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1f8b0673-6848-4c5b-a68a-7173cc3da57d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/40295367"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Juan Carlos es muy amable y siempre estuvo al pendiente del viaje, el departamento hermoso y muy cómodo, con una excelente ubicación justo como lo necesitaba.","created_at":"2015-09-21T11:39:47Z","id":47618867,"language":"es","localized_date":"Septiembre de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Juan Carlos","host_name":"Juan Carlos","id":757418,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/757418/profile_pic/1399393611/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/757418"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Claudia","host_name":"Claudia","id":23253596,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fce8b285-bf24-4071-9cb3-c276e75564bc.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/23253596"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"El apt es realmente espectacular.

We really appreciated his thoughtfulness as a host, and familiarity with the neighborhood. He had us covered for details we didn’t even think of yet which was greatly appreciated. The apartment was a one of a kind. It’s in an amazing location, and felt like sanctuary filled with natural light. We hope to stay here again next time we visit BA.","created_at":"2016-06-29T00:32:19Z","id":82633353,"language":"en","localized_date":"Junio de 2016","response":"Muchas gracias Emilse por vuestra simpatía y buena onda !

The kitchen is well stocked (I had no problem cooking meals) and the wifi worked very well.

Juan Carlos was very attentive, helping us to both move in and move out and generously offering to store our bags for the day and get a \"remis\" (ride to the airport)  as we had a late flight departure.  He could not have been more helpful.  There are a couple of flights of stairs needed to access the apartment, which would be fine for anyone with a regular level of fitness.
