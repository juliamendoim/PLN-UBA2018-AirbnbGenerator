There is a convenience store around the corner and a larger grocery store about 3-4 blocks away.  Although the block/neighborhood is quiet, it is right on a bus route, which means there's loud noise every 10-20 minutes if you're trying to sleep with the windows open (frankly, it didn't bother us, as most of the time we kept windows closed and used the A/C).  The building is fairly new (doorman told us it was built in 2014), looks great and is well maintained.  Neighbors were courteous and friendly. \n The 24-hour doorman arrangement is great for safety and to have someone who can answer quick/basic questions.  The unit is comfortable and Shane was a very responsive and welcoming host.  There are laundry facilities in the basement, which we used once (note: there's only one washer and one dryer, so you may need to wait to use them).  We also booked and used the events room on the top floor, for a gathering of about 12 people (although the room is big enough for perhaps 50 or more).  It was very convenient, as for a nominal fee you can use their dishware and silverware and not have to worry about cleaning up at the end of your party.  Beware, though, you will need to vacate the room at 1am, which is pretty early by Argentine standards (this may have been due to our event being on a Monday - not sure if the \"curfew\" is different on weekends).  We did not use the swimming pool, but it looked very nice.  We did use the included garage space, which was super convenient, even if ingress/egress were a bit awkward due to a steep ramp with a tight turn (don't bring a big car!).  We would absolutely stay at this property again on a future trip.

We felt safe walking around at any time of the night.\nThe location is perfect....a few blocks from the main strip where all the best restaurants and bars are, a few blocks from a major supermarket and a few blocks from a beautiful park not to mention a great ice cream parlour just around the corner.\nShane also offers trips up the mountain and just across the boarder in his 4X4. For those in any doubt...... this is an absolute must!!!! Views are spectacular and its a private comfortable trip that takes you to places that buses can't, all at a fraction of the price!!! \nThank you so so much Shane and Mariana for a fantastic day out.","created_at":"2016-11-10T03:25:42Z","id":113051541,"language":"en","localized_date":"Noviembre de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Shane","host_name":"Shane","id":31531841,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2baa4e3f-2af2-402f-9063-9766c8b65c92.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/31531841"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Colin","host_name":"Colin","id":7936933,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7936933/profile_pic/1442942961/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/7936933"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Shane met us at the San Juan airport and drove us to Mendoza.

The apartment has a fantastic view, is well equipped, and the pool was a major plus. Only downside is the elevator has some issues working consistently, this is not a problem if you are relatively mobile as the apartment is only on the second floor but more difficult if you have a pram. We also had the most spectacular view of fireworks, this is a great place for New Years! Pick up and drop off to the airport were a major plus.

Shane was very helpful and welcoming when we arrived and you couldn't get a better spot. 5 mins walk to park and same to main bars and restaurants. Apartment was clean and comfortable with a great terrace for breakfast and BBQs. A fantastic stay and the pool on the roof was an added bonus. Highly recommend.
