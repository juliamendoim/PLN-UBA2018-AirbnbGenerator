Incluso nos dejaron una sube (forma de pago electrónico para medios de transporte en la ciudad)para usar que fue muy útil en el viaje.\r\n\r\nNos recibieron con una botella de vino y copas.Emmanuel y su cuñada no tuvieron problemas en recibirnos super temprano,por la llegada de nuestro vuelo.Nos encantó todo y estamos agradecidos de la predisposición que sentimos por parte de nuestro anfitrión. Seguramente volveremos a hospedarnos allí.Es un lugar excelente para tu estadía en Buenos Aires.","created_at":"2016-08-24T13:23:07Z","id":96807738,"language":"es","localized_date":"Agosto de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Emmanuel","host_name":"Emmanuel","id":1257968,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1257968/profile_pic/1331252165/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/1257968"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Noelia","host_name":"Noelia","id":53333860,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c52aeed6-7521-4fee-a576-73354453d709.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/53333860"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Muy comunicativo, me hizo todo muy simple.

Much of what I have to say here echoes other reviews. \r\n\r\nFrom the initial contact, Emmanuel was responsive, helpful and kind, (this continued to be true throughout our stay) answering all of our questions.  The booking process for the apartment was very easy, and Emmanuel was very accommodating  about check-in and check-out times.  He truly was a great person to introduce us to Airbnb.  And we feel fortunate to have had this experience.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, Carolina was waiting for us, welcomed us, answered any questions we had and showed us the \"ins and outs\".  She was lovely. The \"helpful hints information sheet\" that Emmanuel had made was  useful, especially, for us, the restaurant and taxi recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was as shown, though I have to say, the quality of light there is much more luminous and beautiful than the photos are able to express.  The couch is different from the one shown and a bit more funky, though it looks as if it could be converted into a bed.  Internet, phone, TV all worked very well. The bed was comfortable, the water pressure and hot water suburb.\r\n\r\nWe stayed for 11 days.  The location is very convenient.  There is easy access to groceries, transportation, pharmacy, restaurants, mobil services, art supplies - even organic produce (a rarity) which gets delivered to a small store on Fridays at the corner of Bompland and either Guatemala or Soler.  \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is really alive with people, and it always felt safe, (although we were not out really late, so I don't have direct experience of early morning hours). \r\n\r\nI would add two more things:\r\nIf you happen to have environment sensitivities, the detergent that Emmanuel had been using at the time of this review for sheets and towels, has a strong and pervasive scent. \r\nAnd, even though it is on the fourth floor, the balcony door is not lockable, (this is on purpose, so folks don't lock themselves outside). Both of these things have easy solutions: (unscented detergent, and a stick the width of the jam so that the sliding door can be blocked from the inside), and I have made them to Emmanuel. So these two issues may be different in the future.\r\n\r\nI feel completely comfortable recommending Emmanuel and his apartment.\r\n\r\nAlison\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-08-08T12:26:44Z","id":92396683,"language":"en","localized_date":"Agosto de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Emmanuel","host_name":"Emmanuel","id":1257968,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1257968/profile_pic/1331252165/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/1257968"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Alison","host_name":"Alison","id":85204902,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/10d4a8e2-a6a2-4889-805f-21adf318cd6d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/85204902"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Notre séjour s'est très bien déroulé grâce au joli logement d'Emmanuel.\r\nLes voisins étaient charmants ( nous offrant des fruits à notre arrivée ) et le gardien très gentil ( soucieux de notre bien être, et nous réservant un taxi pour notre retour ), tout comme Emmanuel qui nous a laissé un téléphone portable pour le joindre à tout moment et une bouteille de vin en guise de bienvenue.

There is a locked front vestibule and an elevator to the apartment itself.\r\n\r\nWe never met Emmanuel, but we communicated through (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) while we were in town and he was very helpful to us. We don't speak Spanish so he helped us make a reservation for Salon Canning, a really wonderful tango milonga. He left us fresh towels when we asked for them. He was also very helpful in coordinating a reasonably-priced driver to take us back to the airport at the end of our stay. (Allow three hours like he recommends!) \r\n\r\nThe location is really wonderful. It's about a 5-minute walk from the Ministro Carranza Station on the Green \"D\" line. The \"D\" line makes it very easy to get all over Buenos Aires. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is in a great area called \"Palermo\" which is actually divided into several smaller districts. Emmanuel's place is in Palermo Hollywood. There is a cute street of restaurants, Fitzroy, very near to it. His building is halfway between Palermo Viejo, one of the trendiest areas in BA, and Las Canitas, a lovely, more relaxed area of restaurants and bars. We easily walked to dinner in Palermo Viejo and Las Canitas on several nights, just about a 15-minute walk in either direction. (Try Parilla Los Cholas in Las Canitas for a delicious, inexpensive dinner with the locals.) \r\n\r\nThe apartment has plenty of room, but the duplex set-up makes it feel cozy. There is a lovely surprise when you turn out the lights upstairs. \r\n\r\nThe air conditioning worked great and there is a little safe to use. \r\n\r\nOne note... I have stayed in a lot of Airbnbs and always pick places with 5-star cleanliness ratings. I was surprised that this place has 5-stars for cleanliness. I might give it 3.5 or 4. The bathroom was very clean, as was the bed and the linens. However, the floors and some of the surfaces were dusty and there was a lot of hair around. I dropped something by the bed and wished that I hadn't looked under it. There was at least an inch of hair and dust. Overall, I would say that the apartment is clean in a general way, but that it definitely wasn't spotless. I would still stay at this place again, but I would have appreciated a heads-up to expect this before I arrived.

As for Emmanuel's place, it was fantastic. Conveniently located in Palmero Hollywood with only a short walk to the nightlight (and boy is it a nightlife - open early the next day every day).

(Santa Fe also provided many helpful resources such as a large grocery store, pharmacies and an excellent bakery only a block or two away.) There is no doorman for the building but security is careful, with a good lock system on both the apt door and the building door, plus 24-hr camera com on the entrance. Due to the cool spring weather I didn't use the little balcony but it would be a definite asset in warmer months. A big thank you to Emmanuel and his family for their good communication throughout and fast response to any inquiries. I really appreciated the basics stocked in the fridge - especially having arrived as I did during a 3-day rain storm.
