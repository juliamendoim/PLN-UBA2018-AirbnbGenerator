We loved the area, bohemian chic, with a great market, the feria verde twice a week (unsweetened yogurt !), lovely shops and the museum of modern art around the corner. There is a direct bus to the area of Recoleta as well, so it's great place to visit Buenos Aires.\nThe flat is vintage and lovingly decorated, which is great. However, the pots and pans have seen better days (about ten years ago) so this and the rusty cutlery could do with an upgrade.\nAlejandra showed us the ropes on arrival and we had a very good communication with her whenever we had a question, she was very helpful providing suggestions and tips.","created_at":"2017-10-09T16:37:27Z","id":201939979,"language":"en","localized_date":"Octubre de 2017","response":"Dear Emmanuelle, thank you for your review, I take note of your suggestions.

Todos y cada uno de sus requerimientos fueron concedidos. Llegó un sábado a la medianoche y fui personalmente a recibirlo para que no tuviera que quedarse en el aeropuerto, llevando la SIM CARD que había pedido, que inclusive se la regalé. Pidió si podía cambiarle dólares a cambio paralelo (40% más alto que el oficial) porque al día siguiente era feriado y no quería cambiar al valor oficial, se lo concedí. Luego pidió dos (2) veces más si podía cambiarle y cada vez tuve que ir al departamento personalmente. Siempre se dirigió a mí en un tono imperativo, ligeramente displicente y como si yo tuviera obligación de satisfacer sus pedidos, nunca se mostró agradecido. El día del check-out encontré la casa desordenada, con bastante vajilla sucia y basura, lo que no me agradó. Tratando de ser amistosa, le pregunté cómo la había pasado y me respondió con un lacónico “OK” lo que me decepcionó un poco. Su comentario me parece algo agresivo y confuso, me pregunto cómo puede decir que el departamento es “frío” cuando se hospedó en pleno verano con temperaturas rozando los 30°. Hace 6 años que soy owner en Airbnb y he hospedado gran cantidad de gente, la mayoría de la cual siempre ha tenido una actitud amistosa que trato de retribuir ayudándolos en lo que esté a mi alcance. Entiendo que a algunos les puede gustar mucho mi espacio y a otros no tanto, cada uno es libre para opinar, pero creo que hay maneras y maneras de dirigirse a alguien que notoriamente se está esforzando para hacerte la estancia agradable. La actitud de Igor para conmigo simplemente reforzó los comentarios de otros propietarios que ya lo habían hospedado, quienes afirmaron que se trata de una persona extraña.

Plenty of antique shops and a pretty good selection of restaurants too. Our favourite was the Pintxos bar just around the corner on Humberto 1st (as good as anything you'll get in San Sebastián in Spain).\n\nI guess you'd describe the apartment as a warehouse apartment. Very cool layout and worked perfectly for us (young couple with a four month old baby). The kitchen had everything we needed to cook at home most nights. The only downside was the hot water in the bathroom was a bit temperamental, but nothing too major.\n\nAlajandra was a great host. Easy to communicate with. She helped us sort out a taxi and was flexible with the arrival (late again). Overall we would definitely recommend the apartment and the area. \n\nOh and one last thing, don't be put off by the busy road when you first arrive at the apartment building. The apartment is right at the back of the building and is super quiet. It's also only two blocks away from the famous Plaza Dorrego and there is a Carrefour Express 30 metres from the front door.

It is very San Telmo-esque, right in San Telmo neighborhood, but inside a wonderful old building, so there's almost never any noise from the neighborhood at all.  The loft, just like the neighborhood, is *made* of bohemian character.  But the important practical things are all wonderful, too - I was amazed how warm I was in such a big space, in an old building.  (Especially up in the bedroom!)  There was always tons of hot water, and it was very convenient to have both a landline and a cell phone to use for local calls.  The loft is just a few doors down from a Carrefour Express, for coffee, bread, snacks, wine, or dinner if you want to cook - the kitchen is very well-equipped.  (I also needed toothpaste and soap...)  And right around the corner, just two blocks away, is Plaza Dorrego, the center of San Telmo neighborhood, with Defensa, its restaurants and shops and parillas and cafes, and of course the Sunday street market.  (A very beloved \"real\" parrilla, El Desnivel, is very close-by, and I bought a beautiful hand-painted dress to wear to the National Ballet of Uruguay at the Teatro Colon from a little boutique in the neighborhood).  \r\n\r\nThe location really is wonderful - first, you have to understand that San Telmo is one of the oldest neighborhoods in BsAs, so the cobbled streets and colonial buildings have a lot of character.  It also feels more like a neighborhood to me than the skyrise apartments of Recoleta, for example.  But it's safe - completely safe - day and night.  (I mean, it's still a big city, so take the care you would in any big city, but I was a woman traveling solo, and I felt fine in the neighborhood at all hours - there are people around until at least 3am, which is when I came home from tango one night.)\r\nThe neighborhood and the loft are also very central, so walkable to Caminito/La Boca, Puerto Madera, Plaza de Mayo, Congreso, etc.  Recoleta is a little bit of a longer walk, but I had beautiful weather, so it didn't matter to me.  But if you don't want to walk, taxies are frequent and inexpensive, and the Subte and bus lines are right on Alejandra's street.  Very, very easy to get around.  Also, Alejandra kindly left a set of recommendations and instructions, and she was very easy to contact and communicate with if ever I needed anything during my stay.  She's a kind, generous, funny, super-interesting person and a wonderful hostess.  When I come back (and I will!) I refuse to stay anywhere else!","created_at":"2013-10-08T10:41:19Z","id":7914074,"language":"en","localized_date":"Octubre de 2013","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Alejandra","host_name":"Alejandra","id":69605,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/69605/profile_pic/1263241426/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/69605"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Rebecca","host_name":"Rebecca","id":806027,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/806027/profile_pic/1377382116/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/806027"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Alejandra is a very special person who has a knack to make guests feel welcome.

Also lots of buses steps from the apt., and we discovered after a few days its easy to refill your bus card at the little shop just below the apt. Several small grocery stores are on the same block so we really made use of the kitchen, which had everything we needed. The only improvement needed is repair of the callbox, as someone outside is able to ring up but whoever in the apartment cannot be heard by the person downstairs, which proved challenging on several occasions.
