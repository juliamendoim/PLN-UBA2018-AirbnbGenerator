Por la noche está cerca de bastantes opciones de restaurantes y bares para tomarse una copa.

What's important to note is he let us check in a few hours early and the day we left let us check out more than a few hours late. We would have been stuck rolling all our stuff through BA if it wasn't for his flexibility. I know it always possible, but if it is, he will accommodate you.\n\nThe place was exactly as described, clean and simple. The terrace is amazing and I recommend having dinner or at least drinks out there one night.\n\nWe didn't explore the neighborhood too much as I had my own agenda closer into the main tourist part of town. If you want to taxi or uber to Recoleta, the other end of Palermo, Puerto Madero, etc, its a 15-20 min drive. Nothing too bad at all, but it did add up after 5 days, so also consider public transport.\n\nThank you for your hospitality Carlos and for checking on us and answering all my questions within minutes.

We stayed there with my (future) mother and sister in law and it was important for me they were comfortable and their experience was easy in terms of language and travel. Carlos assisted with helping my sister in law who arrived a day ahead of the bunch and then received all of us on Sunday morning when we arrived. We had the necessary sets of keys ready for us, and since he lives just across the hallway he was able to help anytime needed (which was a few!) \r\nSome additional considerations worth mentioning are for example the fact that Carlos left 2 SUBE cards at our disposal in the house. If you plan on using public transport, you need one of these cards to top up and travel around with and they aren't apparently that easy to get hold of.  We used them, topped them up again and left them for the next visitors. \r\nThe flat is comfortable and the balcony is really nice and spacious. Sadly the weather didn't permit us making much use of it, but the interior is really well lit so we could enjoy the outside feeling without the cold. \r\nModern appliances are provided in the kitchen and the AC system made the place warm and cozy. There's a laundry room with a dryer in the house. \r\nThe beds are quite firm and provided with memory foam pillows as well as normal pillows. Also bed linens and fluffy towels are provided. The place has 4 single beds, 2 in each room.\r\nThe area is pretty noisy but that's something you should expect in any Buenos Aires area that's near a hub of public transport.

The apartment was perfect for our family of 4. All the rooms were spacious, and the kitchen was well equipped. The table and chairs on the balcony would have been a lovely place to enjoy our morning coffee, if we were there at a warmer time of year. We were happy to see that the apartment building has an elevator, as our son started the vacation on crutches and wasn't able to climb the three flights of stairs to our apartment. It looks like a cafe will be opening in the next month or so on the ground level of the building. That will be a nice addition.\r\nWe didn't find much to do in Villa Crespo itself, so we spent most of the time in Recoleta and Palermo, the neighborhoods our daughter/tour guide was more familiar with. As advertised, the apartment is a short walk to the bus stop and subway station (although the public transportation system is quite confusing to those unfamiliar with it).","created_at":"2015-07-17T12:01:18Z","id":38595451,"language":"en","localized_date":"Julio de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Carlos","host_name":"Carlos","id":1876552,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1876552/profile_pic/1343260261/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/1876552"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Lori","host_name":"Lori","id":20944498,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9d289da3-4fde-475a-ab64-54d8f835136a.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/20944498"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Carlos always responded to my e mails immediately .
