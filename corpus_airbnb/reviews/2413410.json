El departamento está muy bien amueblado, amplio, grande, iluminado y limpio. Marisa pensó en cada detalle, no faltó absolutamente nada durante nuestra estancia. \r\nEn cuanto a la comunicación uno debe decir que no podría ser más perfecto – cualquier cosa pudimos mandarle un mensaje a Marisa o llamarle y ella siempre contestó rapidísimo. \r\nAdemás es departamento está muy bien ubicado; hay varios colectivos justo al lado y el subte también está cerquita. Restaurantes, bares, supermercados y todo lo que uno necesita está cerca también. \r\nVivir en el departamento de Marisa es súper recomendable, la próxima vez que estemos en Buenos Aires seguramente vamos a intentar alquilar este departamento de Marisa de vuelta. ¡Diez puntos! \r\n\r\nWe spent ten days in Marisa’s apartment and I can only say that we had an amazing time! The apartment is spacious, very clean, nicely furnished and bright. Located on the 12th floor you have a fantastic view over Buenos Aires! \r\nCommunication with Marisa was marvelous: whenever we needed anything or whenever there was any issue we could call Marisa or write her a message. She constantly replied to our messages within a very short time. I also found it great that she asked us how we were doing and that she gave us many interesting tips about places to visit in Buenos Aires. \r\nTo my mind the apartment couldn’t have been located any better. Within a short walking distance you can find anything you need: supermarkets, bus stations (right in front of the entrance), subway stations, bars, restaurants etc… The trendy neighborhood of Palermo is also very very close. \r\nI highly recommend Marisa’s apartment in case you are planning to visit the wonderful city of Buenos Aires. Again, thank you very much Marisa! \r\n","created_at":"2015-08-08T12:15:49Z","id":41589802,"language":"es","localized_date":"Agosto de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Marisa","host_name":"Marisa","id":12335462,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/12335462/profile_pic/1402007242/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/12335462"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Christoph","host_name":"Christoph","id":29116579,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/29116579/profile_pic/1433798186/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/29116579"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"La ubicación es muy practica , el barrio muy lindo y el Depto espectacular y muy cómodo tal cual se muestra en las fotos.

Guest feedback is very important to me and I have already undergone renovations in the windows to improve soundproofing in all the rooms. Moreover, both balanced draft stoves facing the street have just been removed in both bedrooms and a new silent cold/hot  air conditioner is in place in the second one. The  upstairs neighbour has already cut the nails of her eleven year old dog-I had never noticed him, honestly. Both bedrooms are now quiet also for those not used to living in a big city.  Hope to have another opportunity to host you if your travels bring you back to Buenos Aires.","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Marisa","host_name":"Marisa","id":12335462,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/12335462/profile_pic/1402007242/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/12335462"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Didier","host_name":"Didier","id":8332793,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/94ae37f0-79c0-45a4-a7e7-3a383f18ea62.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/8332793"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Marisa is a wonderful host And will do everything to make you comfortable.","created_at":"2017-08-23T18:38:40Z","id":186120022,"language":"en","localized_date":"Agosto de 2017","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Marisa","host_name":"Marisa","id":12335462,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/12335462/profile_pic/1402007242/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/12335462"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Olivia","host_name":"Olivia","id":2973992,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/12fcd336-30d7-46df-8a91-a76d3eb468a3.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/2973992"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"HOST -  Marisa was exceptionally helpful and responsive to all our questions and needs.
