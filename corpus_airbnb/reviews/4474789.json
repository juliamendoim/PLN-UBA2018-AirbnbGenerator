Martin was more than a great host and made extra few miles to help me with various things. The only downside is that the bedroom is a bit noisy during the day (at night it’s fine) so if you’re sensitive to noise and wanna take naps take this into consideration. All in all - lovely apartment, great host, perfect location. Highly recommended.","created_at":"2017-10-02T17:07:19Z","id":199652660,"language":"en","localized_date":"Octubre de 2017","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Martin","host_name":"Martin","id":4211617,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f00b5a53-4b89-4d91-bc83-c28c94b28399.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/4211617"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Barak","host_name":"Barak","id":3255438,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/cb7849b3-3d0a-41b6-a9ee-dc71e8aaebd9.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/3255438"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"The apartment is located in a perfect location, easy access to lots and lots of bars and restaurants.

It's updated, comfortable, roomy enough for two, with many nearby conveniences. Enjoy a cup of coffee on the cozy patio in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening. Be sure to get daily fresh fruit from the corner market across on Guatemala or small staple items across Malabia. \n\nWe found walking or taxis to be our mode for travel and both were easy to do. The location is well known to taxis and we were able to get to some locations by foot - such as the famous Don Julio's and wonderful gelato, as well as the Evita Museum. TIP: If you don't speak Spanish and are taking taxis to your destinations, write out the address (street first, then number) to hand to your driver. This will ease communication for both parties.\n\nCreature comforts matter during a week long stay - and Martin's home has them. The bathroom has great counter space for two and wonderful water pressure from the shower head. The bed was comfortable and we enjoyed having the fan overhead to cool and to create a bit of white noise. Amply equipped, the kitchen was all we needed as most meals were taken away. But it seemed well stocked to do some light cooking. Seating is everywhere - stools, chairs, and futon with level space to eat, place your laptop, or store travel gear. Outlets are in abundance. The building caretakers are very friendly and make you feel comfortable as a guest. And even small things are in place, such as hooks to store the keys when not in use.\n\n\n.

BTW, we rented here for two weeks- it was our home. \r\nWe appreciate the firm queen-size bed for a good sleep and two satellite channels in English (BBC and CNN). Two blocks is the DISCO supermarket for any cooking needs and a laundry only 3 blocks up Malibia for drop off at $3.50 US a load.

The flat is in a terrific location, in a very lively neighbourhood but the location allows for a real intimate neighbourhood feeling so that one can make friends with people (as we were able to do within our two week stay). This barrio mirrors the big city in terms of food, style, music, dancing, clubbing, and attitude ... .  The whole experience is rounded off by the openess and friendliness of the people in Argentina.  One caveat though:  the more one makes an effort to speak Spanish, the better - no need to be perfect, but the effort is worth the result - whilst many people speak at least a bit of English, they really appreciate your effort ... .","created_at":"2016-10-27T06:27:54Z","id":110549451,"language":"en","localized_date":"Octubre de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Martin","host_name":"Martin","id":4211617,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f00b5a53-4b89-4d91-bc83-c28c94b28399.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/4211617"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Andreas","host_name":"Andreas","id":37999116,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/37999116/profile_pic/1436462948/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/37999116"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"The apartment is in a great area of Palermo, though we found it a bit noisy at night when the bars closed.
