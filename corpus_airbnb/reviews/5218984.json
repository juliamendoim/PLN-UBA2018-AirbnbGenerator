I'm a painter and the light and space were inspiring... I made five new paintings there! The views are wonderful and it's great to sit on the balcony in the sun - I had a perfect sight of the September 2015 lunar eclipse (the red moon!). The building is super secure and quiet (the security men on the desk are helpful and open the door for you when you return late at night, as I do because I'm a tango dancer), and the apartment is like a home, comfortable and welcoming and exactly as in the photos on Airbnb. Angie and her team in Buenos Aires looked after me so well, everyone was kind and accommodating, I was able to extend my stay by a few days easily and I was so grateful for that. I was there in some unusually cold weather, but the heating is easy and reliable, and the apartment was cosy and warm. The laundry in the basement was always available when I wanted it (you need coins of $1 and $2 pesos to use it which is normal in Buenos Aires apartment buildings, so save your change!). Decata (cafe on the corner) is fab for breakfast (or any meal) and has a great roof terrace. It's easy to walk to Ministro Carranza Subte or to the calle Niceto Vega for the bus to the centre. There are Carrefour and Dia mini-markets within a couple of blocks, and a great co-operative organic food market in the calle Bonpland. I enjoyed a very happy and peaceful 5 weeks in this apartment and I would recommend it to anyone! Thank you Angie. I will always have very fond memories of your lovely home and your kindness to me.

Very near restaurants and next to a great cafe, but on a quiet street. Angeles is a easy to communicate with through the Airbnb app, though she couldn't meet us in person (as she notes in her profile, she spends a good deal of time abroad), She did send someone to greet us on her behalf. Unfortunately, the contact didn't speak English and my Spanish is limited. Therefore the tour of the apartment was basic and left us with questions later on. I was there with a friend and we planned for one of us to sleep in the bedroom and the other on the daybed. Both the bed and daybed are relatively small (as the photos show), but do know this if you're someone who needs a big bed. Given the temperatures in BA the weekend we stayed in the apartment, the fact that both rooms had AC units was a big plus--as were the 24-hour doorman and onsite laundry.

The flat was as pictured and in a great part of Buenos Aires with lots of things to do nearby! The only downside was that laundry access was pretty difficult given that the machines in the building required 1 and 2 peso coins to work and small change like that is pretty hard to come by.

Her assistant met us at the apartment to give us the keys and show us the amenities. SHe was very friendly and gave us a pamphlet on local things to do in the city. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures and the huge windows gave it a really awesome vibe. There is easy to adjust heat and ac and we both slept very well in the comfortable bed. There is plenty of room in the kitchen to do some cooking and it's absolutely lovely drinking wine on the balcony. The area is very safe and walking distance to cool bars and boutiques.

Location is excellent, just a few minutes (walking) away from the nice restaurants / bars / clubs in Palermo. Despite the appartment is still quiet so you'll have good sleep at night. Appartment has a nice & spacious livingroom with a well-equiped kitchen. Also loved sitting in the sun on the balcony with a cup of coffee. Bedroom & bathroom (en-suite) are nice & comfortable as well. Owner provides also a lot of information about the city & neighborhood which is really nice when it's your first time in Buenos Aires.","created_at":"2015-08-05T18:14:19Z","id":41279934,"language":"en","localized_date":"Agosto de 2015","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Angeles","host_name":"Angeles","id":6229362,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6229362/profile_pic/1435166290/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/6229362"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Saul","host_name":"Saul","id":31096296,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/31096296/profile_pic/1437922015/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/31096296"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Just perfect!
