It was a great hub for us to explore Buenos Aires. Plus it's within walking distance to a great park that was one of the highlights of our stay.

This apartment is exactly as described, but we found some things to be better than we expected: if you're wanting to stay in the San Telmo area, this is the best location.  It's perfectly situated on a quiet, but not remote, street in the very lively area of San Telmo.  We loved the host and felt she welcomed us well and provided more amenities than we expected. (It may seem small, but having things like a hairdryer on the wall and a small mirror and umbrella to use were nice details that this place provided.) The bed was comfortable. I was very wary about the mosquitoes that were mentioned in precious posts, but didn't get one in the apartment.

She went out of her way to accommodate my arrival and she immediately returned my messages both before and during the rental. She is kind, thoughtful and helpful, and seems adamant about ensuring her renters' satisfaction. \r\n\r\nThe photos of the apartment are entirely accurate; it's a clean, vibrant, lovely place to stay. I, myself, like to cook, and the kitchen has everything one needs. The bed is comfortable, the water is hot (if/when you need it), and the terrace is wonderful. \r\n\r\nThe apartment's location is remarkable (in the middle of the colorful San Telmo neighborhood). Considering the cacophony of the neighborhood, noise from the street doesn't seep through nearly as much as I thought it would. That said, the building itself can produce a variety of sounds: I was there for a week and on some days it was absolutely silent, while on others I could easily hear the neighbors going about their daily lives. Not a complaint, simply a fact of life. \r\n\r\nKudos to Alejandra for the screens on the windows. I was amazed by the amount of mosquitoes so here are some words of advice:\r\n-the mosquitoes will come at dusk, so if you want to be on the terrace, prepare yourself. There are some repellents in one of the kitchen drawers.\r\n-never, never, leave a door open to the outside. If you want the terrace door open, use the pull-down screen.\r\n-I took huge precautions and I still had mosquitoes buzzing in my ears a few of the nights. In this case, the ceiling fan above the bed will help to blow them away.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for me to imagine not staying here again. Great location, hassle-free rental, perfect host, lovely apartment...all at a decent price. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","created_at":"2016-10-24T12:39:47Z","id":110156021,"language":"en","localized_date":"Octubre de 2016","response":"","reviewee":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Alejandra","host_name":"Alejandra","id":1675731,"is_superhost":true,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/41ad4ea3-a2da-4523-a584-8714e22b1c06.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/1675731"},"reviewer":{"deleted":false,"first_name":"Jordán","host_name":"Jordán","id":4877378,"is_superhost":false,"picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/682f5fbb-3a1e-45ef-8418-14acc8ca11ca.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/4877378"}},{"collection_tag":null,"comments":"Le quartier est sans doute est des plus agréables, et l'appartement d'Alejandra a été un vrai paradis pour nous.

We had the best time strolling around the neighborhood (in fact, we didn't go much futher than 8 blocks or so), and we were genuinely heartbroken when we had to move on to our next destination!\r\n\r\nAlejandra was a fantastic host and went out of her way to make our visit more comfortable. Despite traveling elsewhere during our stay, she was quick to respond to our questions via email and left us a super helpful set of tips, instructions, and recommendations on the dining room table. Her neighbor (who checked us in) was a HUGE help as well, especially when the gas went out for a few minutes and we needed to light the pilot light.\r\n\r\nShould we ever return to Buenos Aires, Alejandra's place will be the first we'll go!
