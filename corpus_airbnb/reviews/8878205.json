The apartment itself is in a really great location in Palermo which is a really great suburb with a lot of great boutique food and drink places, great vibe and a little upmarket feel. The apartment is as the pictures show, small and tidy everything you need. The only negative is that the walls and windows must be quite thin, he noise from the street is quite loud - but maybe what you would expect for the location.

Bathroom is clean and modern, good water pressure and temperature. Good fast wifi service and cable TV. Apartment faces the street so there is some street noise, but all of Buenos Aires is like this. Some noise from the neighbours can be heard through the wall, but nothing excessive. Location is three blocks from Palermo subway station and a 10-15 min walk to Palermo Soho shops/bars/restos. 10 min walk to Palermo Hollywood restaurants. One block from Distrito Arcos shopping centre. Neighbourhood is residential and gives you the Palermo Viejo feel. Grocery store next door, ice cream on the corner, and laundry on the next block. We didn't meet Julien but he left the keys for us at the grocery store next door. He responded to messages very quickly and in a friendly manner also offered us a reasonably priced taxi to meet us at the airport as well as maid service half way through our 8 day stay.
