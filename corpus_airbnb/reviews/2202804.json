The space is exactly as pictured and I was happy to experience the light pouring in and filling the space just as I saw in the photographs. The location is wonderful- in the heart of Palermo Soho, it is just a few minute's walk from the Subte and great things to do, yet still far enough away from the main hustle and bustle of the neighborhood to feel very residential and relaxing. \r\n\r\nMax was also very accessible to us throughout our stay. We were easily able to contact him when we had questions.

The wifi also worked great.\r\n\r\nThe location is good. We walked to almost all of our meals and to about half of the sites we wanted to see.
