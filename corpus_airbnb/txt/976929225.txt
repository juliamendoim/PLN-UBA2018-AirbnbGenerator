We loved our stay in this lovely cabin. Sofia and her husband were welcoming and kind hosts, and the handmade details of the cabin (constructed by the owners) were very special. The view down the valley is spectacular, and sitting on the deck in the evening sun was just what we needed at the end of the day. Thor the friendly pup was a great addition as well!
