Esta es la segunda vez que nos quedamos en el hermoso departamento de Elisa. Es espectacular y súper recomendable, desde la calidez de los huéspedes hasta los detalles súper cuidados del departamento.


This is the second time my wife and I have stayed at Elisa's beautiful apartment in Palermo. Our experience has been great as was our first stay here. Everything, from the warmth of the hosts (even willing to receive us arriving late at night!) to the carefull and well-thought details of the apartment, contributes to a superb experience.
I recommend it 100%
